## Learning outcome

<br>

1. aa
2. Importance on how scripts are loaded, order (async and defer attributes for scripts) using async if you don't care about execution order, if script doesn't depend on another script
   1. Use defer at the beginning of html head tag because we want to download the js as soon as possible but we don't want it t one executed until all html is parsed
   2. Use defer for scripts that have to be used until all html is parsed
   3. Async. Script shouldn't rely on any other script
